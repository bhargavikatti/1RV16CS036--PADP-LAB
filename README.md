Lab Programs for Parallel Architecture and Distributed Programming

1	a)Write an OpenMp program that computes the value of PI using Monto-Carlo Algorithm.
  b)Write a MPI program that computes the value of PI using Monto-Carlo Algorithm.	

2	Write an OpenMP program that computes a simple matrix-matrix multiplication using dynamic memory allocation. 
  a) Illustrate the correctness of the program. 
  b) Justify the inference when outer “for” loop is parallelized with and without using the explicit data scope variables.	
  
3	A) Write an OpenMP program for Cache unfriendly sieve of Eratosthenes and Cache friendly Sieve of Eratosthenes for enumerating prime numbers upto N and prove the correctness. 
  B)Write an OpenMP program for Cache unfriendly sieve of Eratosthenes and Cache friendly and parallel Sieve of Eratosthenes for 
   enumerating prime numbers upto N and prove the correctness.
   
4	Write an OpenMP program to convert a color image to black and white image.
  a) Demonstrate the performance of different scheduling techniques for varying chunk values       
  b) Analyze the scheduling patterns by assigning a single color value for an image for each thread  	
  
5	Write an OpenMP parallel program for Points Classification. Prove the correctness of sequential program with that of parallel.	

6	Write an OpenMP program for Word search in a file and illustrate the performance using different sizes of file.	

7	Write MPI- C program which demonstrates how to "multitask", that is, to execute several unrelated and distinct tasks simultaneously, using MPI for parallel execution.	

8	Write MPI- C program which approximates an integral using a quadrature rule.	

9	Write MPI- C program which estimates the time it takes to send a vector of N double precision values through each process in a ring.
